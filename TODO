named indices (index representation needs an overhaul)

multiple primary keys (oracle, db2, others?)

better documentation for Column::sql_add_column

Additional transformations (deleted, modified columns, added/modified/indices
(probably need em named first), added/deleted tables

port and test with additional databases

sql CREATE TABLE output should convert integers
(i.e. use DBI qw(:sql_types);) to local types using DBI->type_info plus a hash
to fudge things
